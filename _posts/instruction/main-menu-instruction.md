** How It Works **

Kids who ALREADY know the individual letters and sounds can skip the Better Alphabet(TM) and jump right into Secret Stories(R) Phonics play!

Kids who DON'T know the individual letters and sounds should play with BOTH the Better Alphabet(R) and the Secret Stories(R) Phonics, as they work best together! (Kids should sing the Better Alphabet(TM) Song twice a day, every day, for 2 weeks to 2 months (until mastered) and at the same time, start learning and playing with the Secrets! Read more about this in the instructions for each.)

* BETTER ALPHABET(TM) 

Select this option to learn individual letters and sounds fast and strengthen the critical connections between the sounds letters make and the symbols that represent them. The Better Alphabet Song uses music to engage muscle memory and help build strength, stamina and speed for beginning reading and writing!

* SECRET STORIES PHONICS 

Select this option to learn the "secret" sounds that letters make when they get together, and use the sound pictures to help remember the phonics sounds and spelling for independent reading and writing!
