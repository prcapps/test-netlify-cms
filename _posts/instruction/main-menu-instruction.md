#### ***How It Works***

* BETTER ALPHABET OPTION

Select this option to learn individual letters and sounds fast and strengthen the critical connections between the sounds letters make and the symbols that represent them. The Better Alphabet Song uses music to engage muscle memory and help build strength, stamina and speed for beginning reading and writing!

* SECRET STORIES PHONICS OPTION

Select this option to learn the "secret" sounds that letters make when they get together, and use the sound pictures to help remember the phonics sounds and spelling for independent reading and writing!
