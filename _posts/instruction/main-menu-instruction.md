#### **How It Works**

Select the BETTER ALPHABET to learn individual letters and sounds fast with the Better Alphabet, and discover the "secret" sounds that letters make when they get together with the Secret Stories!  

This app is most effective when used in conjunction with the Secret Stories(R) Kit (https://www.TheSecretStories.com).



The purpose of these “Blending Brainteasers” is strengthen the connection between the sounds letters make and the symbols (letter/letter patterns) that represent them. The goal is to increase automaticity for moving quickly from “sound to symbol” (for decoding/reading) and “symbol to sound” (for encoding/writing). Using musical exercises to mimic the decoding and encoding process helps to build strength, stamina and speed for easy and effortless reading and writing.
