##### ***Strengthening "Sound-Symbol" Connections in the Brain***

*The Better Alphabet™ Song strengthens the critical connections between the sounds letters make and the symbols that represent them. It uses music to engage muscle memory and help build strength, stamina and speed for reading and writing.*

PLAY SONG OPTION:\
Select the "Play Song" option button to sing through all of the letters and sounds with the Better Alphabet™ Song. *Sing it twice a day, every day, for two weeks to two months* for fast mastery of all the individual letters and sounds! There are two very important things for kids to keep in mind when singing this song:

1. *Eye Glue*\
   In order to strengthen the sound-symbol (i.e. speech to print) connections in the brain, kids need to keep their eyes "glued" to each letter as they sing its sound, so as to SEE what they sing, and sing what they SEE! This helps to cement the “sound-symbol” connections in the brain! Keeping eyes “glued to the letters” is what’s referred to as using your “eye glue!” [](https://www.thesecretstories.com/the-secret-stories-musical-brain-teasers-toggle-id-1/better-alphabet-eye-glue-and-muscle-mouth/)
2. *Muscle Mouth*\
   Equally important when singing is using your “muscle mouth,” which means telling kids to really “work their lips, tongue and teeth” by over exaggerating the sounds. Tell kids that this is the only way to make sure that their mouth muscles are strong enough to “capture and keep” all of the sounds! This over-exaggeration when singing helps to cement the sounds into muscle memory for easy, non-conscious retrieval.

PLAY SOUND OPTION:\
Tap on any letter to hear the letter name and sound. 

RANDOM PLAY OPTION:\
Select the "Random Play" option to play random letter sounds and then tap on corresponding letter. If the correct letter is selected within 5 second, it will "glow and grow" and a bell sound play. If the wrong letter/letters are selected, nothing will happen until the 5 second time limit has expired, and then the correct letter will "glow and grow" and the correct sound will be played. (The same will occur if no letter is selected.)
