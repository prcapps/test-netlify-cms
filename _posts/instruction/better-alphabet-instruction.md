### ***Strengthening Sound-Symbol Connections in the Brain***

PLAY SONG OPTION:

Select the "Play Song" option button to sing through all of the letters and sounds with the Better Alphabet™ Song. \
\
*Sing it twice a day, every day, for two weeks to two months* for fast mastery of all the individual letters and sounds! There are two very important things for kids to keep in mind when singing this song:

1. *Eye Glue*\
   In order to strengthen the sound-symbol (i.e. speech to print) connections in the brain, kids need to keep their eyes "glued" to each letter as they sing its sound, so as to SEE what they sing, and sing what they SEE! This helps to cement the “sound-symbol” connections in the brain! Keeping eyes “glued to the letters” is what’s referred to as using your “eye glue!” [](https://www.thesecretstories.com/the-secret-stories-musical-brain-teasers-toggle-id-1/better-alphabet-eye-glue-and-muscle-mouth/)
2. *Muscle Mouth*

   Equally important when singing is using your “muscle mouth,” which means telling kids to really “work their lips, tongue and teeth” by over exaggerating the sounds. Tell kids that this is the only way to make sure that their mouth muscles are strong enough to “capture and keep” all of the sounds! This over-exaggeration when singing helps to cement the sounds into muscle memory for easy, non-conscious retrieval. (If you have the [Secret Stories®](https://www.thesecretstories.com/) Kit, you can read more about this in the book. You can also find printable versions of the Better Alphabet™ anchors for both [individual ](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Secret-Stories-Better-Alphabet-Phonics-Mats-Individual-Use-Distance-Learning-1727516)and [classroom](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Secret-Stories-Better-Alphabet-Anchors-for-Letter-Sounds-Phonics-Instruction-1152292) use, as well as the song [video](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Secret-Stories-Better-Alphabet-Song-Video-for-FAST-Letters-Sound-Mastery-5953615).)

PLAY SOUND OPTION:

Tap on a specific letter to hear the letter name and sound. 

RANDOM PLAY OPTION:

Select the "Random Play" option to hear a random letter sound and identify the corresponding letter by tapping on its sound. If correct, selected, it "glow and grow" \

Letter Runs & Blending Brainteasers

Within a week or two after beginning to sing the *Better Alphabet™*, you can raise the bar with the *Letter Runs* as a fun challenge! For learners who already know the individual letters and sounds, you can jump right in and start “playing” with the blending brainteasers! These can be sung in small snippets of time, as they are not really songs, but reading and writing exercises set to music! They are most effective when practiced in spontaneous fashion during moments of downtime— waiting for lunch, waiting for the bus, etc..

These random moments of downtime throughout the day can really add up, and challenging kids with musical brain teasers that mimic reading and writing is a great way to “milk” their maximum value! Just remember that the goal of these exercises is to continue “raising the bar” for deeper skill-ownership, so you want to continue to “mix it up” by plugging-in different letters, sounds, and Secret phonics patterns, so as to constantly alter how they are sung!

The purpose of these “Blending Brainteasers” is strengthen the connection between the sounds letters make and the symbols (letter/letter patterns) that represent them. The goal is to increase automaticity for moving quickly from “sound to symbol” (for decoding/reading) and “symbol to sound” (for encoding/writing). Using musical exercises to mimic the decoding and encoding process helps to build strength, stamina and speed for easy and effortless reading and writing.
