##### ***Strengthening "Sound-Symbol" Connections in the Brain***

*The Better Alphabet™ Song strengthens the critical connections between the sounds letters make and the symbols that represent them. It uses music to engage muscle memory and help build strength, stamina and speed for reading and writing.* **Note: Kids who already know the individual letters and sounds can skip the Better Alphabet™.)**

PLAY SONG OPTION:\
Select the "Play Song" option button to sing through all of the letters and sounds with the Better Alphabet™ Song. *Sing it twice a day, every day, for two weeks to two months* for fast mastery of all the individual letters and sounds! There are two very important things for kids to keep in mind when singing this song:

1. *Eye Glue*\
   In order to strengthen the sound-symbol (i.e. speech to print) connections in the brain, kids need to keep their eyes "glued" to each letter as they sing its sound, so as to SEE what they sing, and sing what they SEE! This helps to cement the "sound-symbol" connections in the brain! Keeping eyes "glued to the letters" is what’s referred to as using your "eye glue!" [](https://www.thesecretstories.com/the-secret-stories-musical-brain-teasers-toggle-id-1/better-alphabet-eye-glue-and-muscle-mouth/)
2. *Muscle Mouth*\
   Equally important when singing is using your "muscle mouth," which means telling kids to really "work their lips, tongue and teeth" by over exaggerating the sounds. Tell kids that this is the only way to make sure that their mouth muscles are strong enough to "capture and keep" all of the sounds! This over-exaggeration when singing helps to cement the sounds into muscle memory for easy, non-conscious retrieval. (If you have the [Secret Stories®](https://www.thesecretstories.com/) Kit, you can read more about this in the book.

PLAY SOUND OPTION:\
Tap on any letter to hear the letter name and sound. 

RANDOM PLAY OPTION:\
Select the "Random Play" option to test letter-sound knowledge and speed! Play the sound and tap on the corresponding letter. 

* If the correct letter is selected within 10 seconds, it will be highlighted and a bell sound will play. 
* If the incorrect letter is selected, red will appear around its edges and no sound will play. This will continue with each wrong selection until the time limit has expired. Then the correct letter will fill the screen with the option to "Play the Sound" for more practice. (This will also occur if no selection is made.)
