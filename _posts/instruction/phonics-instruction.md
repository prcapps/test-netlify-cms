---
*Secret Stories® explain the sounds letters make when they get together, with pictures to help kids remember for reading and writing. The more Secrets kids know, the more words they can read and write!* 

*But remember, these are "grown-up" reading and writing SECRETS, so be sure to let kids know that they have to be "big enough" to hear them! (This only makes them want them MORE!)* 

*Kids can listen to stories and play their sounds independently, as well as use them strategically to read and spell words.* 

*Note: Do not wait for individual letter sound mastery to start sharing Secrets! The Secrets are best shared simultaneously with the individual letter sounds (via the Better Alphabet™ Song), as they help kids understand WHY the often don't make the sounds that they should. This aligns with the brain's "need to know" and actually makes it easier for kids learn both. It also serves to fast-track access to MORE of the "code" they need to read and write!*

**INDEPENDENT PLAY**\
To access the "Play Story" and "Play Sound" buttons, just tap on any Secret Story phonics pattern. 

PLAY STORY OPTION\
Select the "Play Story" option to listen to the story that explains the sound.  

PLAY SOUND OPTION\
Select the "Play Sound" option to play the sound.

Allow kids to explore freely and play the stories and sounds, as desired. They love listening to the stories over and over again as they mimic their sounds. They also love to tell and retell the stories in their own way! (As long as "their story" ends with the correct sound, it's fine!) 

RANDOM PLAY OPTION:\
Select the "Random Play" option to play random stories and sounds, and then tap on the corresponding letter. If the correct letter is selected within 5 second, it will "glow and grow" and a bell sound play. If the wrong letter/letters are selected, nothing will happen until the 5 second time limit has expired, and then the correct letter will "glow and grow" and the correct sound will be played. (The same will occur if no letter is selected.)  

**USING SECRETS TO READ, WRITE & SPELL**\
The Secret Stories® aren't just fun, they're tools! In the word /this/, the letter /t/ isn't making the sound that it should, which means telling kids that "there must be a Secret in it!"

* *To Read*\
  *Kids need to know the Secret about /th/ in order to read the word "this," as well as lots of other words, like: "this, them, that," etc. If they can't read it, ask them if they see any Secrets in it, and encourage them to refer back to the Secret Stories® pictures to find the letters and recall their sound/sounds. You can also ask them to retell the story, and if they can't remember, just click on "PLAY STORY" so they can listen.*
* *To Write/Spell*\
  In the same way that Secrets help kids read, they can also be used to help them spell/write words. When trying to sound-out the word "this," ask if they hear any Secret sounds in it? They will notice their tongue sticking out, and should be able to find the corresponding Secret showing letters doing the same. Then they can copy those letters down on their paper.

*You will notice kids referring back to the Secrets constantly, as they quickly become their lifeline for reading and writing. For this reason, the app is most effective when used with the Secret Stories® Kit, which includes the posters and/or cards for easy and constant visual access (as well as the Secret Stories® book and musical blending song download for comprehensive instruction).*
