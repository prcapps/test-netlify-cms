**Secret Stories® Phonics**

Learn the "secret" stories that explain the sounds that letters make when they get together!

The purpose of these “Blending Brainteasers” is strengthen the connection between the sounds letters make and the symbols (letter/letter patterns) that represent them. The goal is to increase automaticity for moving quickly from “sound to symbol” (for decoding/reading) and “symbol to sound” (for encoding/writing). Using musical exercises to mimic the decoding and encoding process helps to build strength, stamina and speed for easy and effortless reading and writing.
