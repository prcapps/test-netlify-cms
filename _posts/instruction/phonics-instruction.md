***Secret Stories® explain the sounds letters make when they get together, with pictures to help kids remember for reading and writing. The more Secrets kids know, the more words they can read and write!***  

Kids can listen stories and sounds on their own (as they would with any story), as well as use them strategically to read and spell words, as needed.

For younger kids, you can even tell them know that these are "grown-up" reading and writing SECRETS, and they have to be "big enough" in order to learn them (which only makes kids want them more!)

Note: Remember NOT to wait for individual letter sound mastery (with the Better Alphabet™ Song) before starting with the Secrets, as they are best learned simultaneously! Knowing that there are grown, up reading and writing "secrets" that explain why letters don't always make the sounds that they should actually makes it easier for kids to learn both. This also helps satisfy the brain's need to know, and fast-track more of the "code" kids NEED to read and write!

***Getting Started***\
Tap on a Secret Story to access the "Play Story" and "Play Sound" buttons.

PLAY STORY BUTTON\
Select the "Play Story" button to listen to the story that explains the sound.  

PLAY SOUND BUTTON\
Select the "Play Sound" button to listen to the phonics sound 

RANDOM PLAY OPTION:\
Select the "Random Play" option to play random stories OR sounds and identify the corresponding Secret. 

* *If the correct Secret (phonics pattern is selected within 10 seconds, it will be highlighted and a bell sound will play.* 
* *If the incorrect Secret (phonics pattern) is selected, red will appear around its edges and no sound will play. This will continue with each wrong selection until the time limit has expired. Then the correct Secret will fill the screen with the option to "Play the Sound" or "Play the Story" for more practice. (This will also occur if no selection is made.)*

***Transforming Tricky Phonics Skills Into Child's Play***\
Kids love listening to the Secret Stories® and mimicking their sounds, and then re-telling them over and over again. It's fine (and even encouraged!) for kids to retell the stories in their own way, as  long as it leads them to the correct sound. 

Encourage them "role play" and do what the letters are doing, as each Secret has an associated action that leads to its sound. For example, lete kids pretend to drive a car and slam on the brakes while screeching, *"ERRRRR!"* (like er/ir/ur), or be bratty and stick their tongue while saying *"THHHHH!"* (like /th/). This helps to cement the sounds in the body, a well as the brain! 

Think "SEE it, SAY it, DO it!" Incorporate the movement, while making the sound, and looking at the visual. This helps to forge deep learning connections in the brain and prompts easier, non-conscious skill retrieval for both reading and writing.

***Using Secrets to Read & Write*** \
The Secrets aren't just fun, they are also the "tools" that kids need to read and write!

For example, in the word /this/, the letter /t/ isn't making the sound that it should, which means telling kids, *"There must be a Secret in it!"*

* *Using Secrets to Read*\
  Kids need to know the /th/ Secret in order to understand WHY the /t/ isn't making the sound it should (like in turtle or Tom). \
  If they can't read it, ask if they see a Secret in it, and encourage them to look at the Secret Stories® pictures, if needed. This will help them to identify the Secret letters and their sound/sounds. Then they can sound-out the word. It is also helpful for them to retell the story, just to solidify ownership of both. (And if they can't remember, they can just click on the "PLAY STORY" button to hear it.)
* *Using Secrets to Write/Spell*\
  In the same way that the Secrets help kids read words, they also help them write and spell. For example, when saying the word, "this," ask if they hear any Secret sounds in it? They should notice their tongue sticking out at the beginning of the word. Then they can refer back to the Secret Story pictures and find the letters that make that sound. Once they do, they can use those letters to spell the word. (If there is more than one option for the sound, like with er/ir/ur, for example, it's  normal for beginning and/or inexperienced readers to randomly use any one of the three, given their lack of text experience. This is normal, though as they read more, which they can now do with the Secrets, this will help to "fine-tune" their spelling choices! If you have the Secret Stories® Kit, you can read more about this in your book.)

***You will notice that kids are constantly referring back to the Secrets, as they are their "lifeline" for both reading and writing! This is one of the reasons this app is best used WITH the*** [](https://www.thesecretstories.com/buy/)***[Secret Stories® Classroom or Home Kit.](https://www.thesecretstories.com/buy/)***

***For Parents...***\
It's incredibly helpful to have the Secret Stories® cards with the sound graphics for easy visual access and constant display, which are included in the [Home/Parent Kit.](https://www.thesecretstories.com/product/parent-resource-homeschool-kit/) This not only provides for quick reference for reading and writing, but also helps to increase recognition of the phonics patterns in text, as they are constantly visible and used. The Secret Stories® Book is also extremely helpful when working with your child at home, as it explains everything about the Secrets and how to teach them, including what to do when a Secret doesn't work (which is actually the most FUN part for kids, as they get to be "Word Doctors!") The Home/Parent Kit also includes the Brainteaser Blending Songs download to help minimize reliance on the sound pictures and speed up sound-skill retrieval for reading and writing.

***For Teachers...***\
The Secret Stories® Kit is a necessity, as students need constant visual access to ALL of the sound posters for reading and writing all day long! While this app is ideal for center play and small group learning fun and practice, it cannot provide the level of support needed for whole-class reference throughout the day. The Secret Stories® book is also critical for teachers to have and refer back to when teaching the Secrets. It includes everything needed for comprehensive instruction, from the "next most likely" sound options, to skill-based assessments, to what happens when a Secret doesn't work—which actually opens the door to the next level of Secret Stories® instruction! Additionally, the Brainteaser Blending Songs download helps to minimize student reliance on the sound posters and increase sound-symbol automaticity for reading and writing.
